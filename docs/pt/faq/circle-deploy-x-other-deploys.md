# Circle deploy x Other deploys

## Circle deploy x Traditional deploy

In traditional deploys, it's common that the application has to pass into different environments until it gets to production. With Charles, the circle deploy system works only in production environment. The release validation is fragmented according to selected circles, in other words, you can open gradually the access to your release to more and more circles.
